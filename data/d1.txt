Acropolis Museum
The Acropolis Museum (Greek: Μουσείο Ακρόπολης, Mouseio Akropolis) is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis of Athens. The museum was built to house every artifact found on the rock and on the surrounding slopes, from the Greek Bronze Age to Roman and Byzantine Greece. The Acropolis Museum also lies over the ruins of part of Roman and early Byzantine Athens.
The museum was founded in 2003 while the Organization of the Museum was established in 2008. It opened to the public on 20 June 2009.[1] More than 4,250 objects are exhibited over an area of 14,000 square metres.
The museum is located by the southeastern slope of the Acropolis hill, on the ancient road that led up to the "sacred rock" in classical times. Set only 280 meters (310 yd), away from the Parthenon, and a 400 meters (440 yd) walking distance from it, the museum is the largest modern building erected so close to the ancient site
The entrance fee to the museum was €1 for the first year and €5 thereafter. As of 2024, the entrance fee during the winter season (1 November through 30 March) is €10, and €15 during the summer season (1 April - 31 October).
The excavation below ground level continues. The site and process are visible through the ground level glass flooring. As of June 2019, the site is available for visitation.
The Acropolis Museum was selected as the motif for a commemorative Euro coin edition: the €10 Greek Acropolis Museum commemorative coin, minted in 2008 to mark the relocation of the museum. On the obverse is a panoramic view of the Acropolis and the new museum lies at the base.
