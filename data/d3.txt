Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art
The Nicholas P. Goulandris Foundation - Museum of Cycladic Art (Greek: Μουσείο Κυκλαδικής τέχνης) is a museum in Athens that houses a notable collection of artifacts of Cycladic art.

The museum was founded in 1986 in order to house the collection of Cycladic and Ancient Greek art belonging to Nicholas and Dolly Goulandris.[1] Starting in the early 1960s, the couple collected Greek antiquities, with special interest in the prehistoric art from the Cyclades islands of the Aegean Sea.[2] The museum's main building, erected in the centre of Athens in 1985, was designed by the Greek architect Ioannis Vikelas [el].[3] In 1991, the Museum acquired a new building, the neo-classical Stathatos Mansion at the corner of Vassilissis Sofias Avenue and Herodotou Street.[4]

The museum's permanent collection includes over 3,000 items, and was described in The New York Times as "one of the world's most significant privately assembled collections of Cycladic antiquities."
Temporary exhibits are housed in the Stathatos Mansion.[3] The museum's temporary exhibitions have included some of the most important Greek and international modern and contemporary artists.
